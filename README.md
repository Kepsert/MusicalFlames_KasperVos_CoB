NOTES:
- Clocked working time on approximately 5~ hours
- Art assets mostly prepared prior to doing the actual challenge
- Due to scope/time constraints I did not work with branch systems in version control, nor did I manage to implement everything I came up with right off the bat
- Alternative mobile mechanic inputs have been designed, not implemented
- Lack of back-to-main menu functionality was intended, but missing due to scope creep
